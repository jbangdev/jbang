= Scripts for jbang demos

These a scripts to record demos for the jbang documentation.

It uses `vhs`(https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) to record the demos.

I prefer to use fork https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs/discussions/644 which has a fork that supports generating svg images.

To install: `brew install agentstation/tap/vhs`

To record run:

`vhs yourvhs.vhs`

It should generate a images/movides in `images` directory.

## Basic rules for `.tape` files

- Use `Source shared/style.tape` at start to use the same style for all demos.
- Do not set `Output` at start, set it from commandline

You can generate svg images for all using:

`find . -name  "*.tape" | grep -v shared/style.tape | xargs -I {} vhs -o {}.svg {}`
