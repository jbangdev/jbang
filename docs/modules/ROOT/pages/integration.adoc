== Build Integration [EXPERIMENTAL]

While `jbang` prepares and builds the underlying jar used for launch there is since v0.40 (for now) experimental API allowing
user included dependencies to influence the generated jar and possible native image.

An example use case enabled by this is to have full Quarkus integration, `jbang quarkuscode.java` will have Quarkus participate to perform its build time optimizations rather than doing it at runtime every time. You can even do `jbang -Dquarkus.dev quarkuscode.java` (since Quarkus 1.11+) run in devmode and have automatic build happen without having to restart.

It works as following:

Before the jar is created `jbang` will scan the classpath for `META-INF/jbang-integration.list`.
Any classes listed in this file will be loaded and jbang will expect and call the following method on these classes:

[source,java]

    /**

    public static Map<String, Object> postBuild(Path temporaryJar,
                                                Path pomFile,
                                                List<Map.Entry<String, String>> repositories,
                                                List<Map.Entry<String, Path>> dependencies,
                                                List<String> comments,
                                                boolean nativeImage) {
    }
}
----

Since version 0.92.0 the full path to the JBang script could be acquired by querying the `jbang.source` system property - `System.getProperty("jbang.source")`

Still very experimental and bound to change. Example of its use can be found in https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/pull/11542[Quarkus].
