To avoid remembering long paths and to enable easy launch of jbang scripts there is an `alias` command
to setup and manage aliases to actual scripts.

  jbang alias add --name hello https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/helloworld.java

will add an alias named `hello` pointing to that github url which then can be run using `jbang hello`.

  jbang alias list

will show you all the aliases that are defined locally.

== Implicit Alias Catalogs

The aliases you create are stored locally (see <<Local Alias Catalogs>>), but JBang can also use remote catalogs.
You can access those catalogs explicitly (see <<Catalogs>>) but it is much easier to use what we call "implicit catalogs", which
are aliases that have a special format and JBang is smart enough to know where to find their definition.

There are two kinds, one that resolves to a Git backed service (github,gitlab and bitbucket) and one that resolves to
https sites.

Examples:

`jbang tree@jbang.dev` will (because of the dot in the name) will lookup a catalog first at https://jbang.dev/jbang-catalog.json.

`jbang hello@jbangdev` will run the alias `hello` as defined in `jbang-catalog.json` found in https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-catalog.

This allows anyone to provide a set of jbang scripts defined in their website or in a github, gitlab or bitbucket repositories.

The full format is `<alias>@<user/org>(/repository)(/branch)(~path)` or `<alias>@<hostname>(/path/to/catalog)` allowing you to do things like:

.Implicit Catalog Examples:
|====
|Command | Description

|`jbang hello@acme.corp`
|`hello` alias found in `https://acme.corp/jbang-catalog.json` if available or the default branch searched on github, gitlab and bitbucket in that order.

|`jbang hello@acme.corp/a/path/to/jbang-catalog.json`
|`hello` alias found in `https://acme.corp/a/path/to/jbang-catalog.json` if available.

|`jbang hello@acme`
|`hello` alias found in `acme/jbang-catalog/jbang-catalog.json` of the default branch searched on github, gitlab and bitbucket in that order.

|`jbang hello@acme/mycatalog`
|`hello` found in `acme/mycatalog/jbang-catalog.json` searched on github, gitlab and bitbucket in that order.

|`jbang hello@acme/mycatalog/dev`
|`hello` found in `acme/mycatalog/jbang-catalog.json` in the `dev` branch searched on github, gitlab and bitbucket in that order.

|`jbang hello@acme~experimental`
|`hello` found in `acme/jbang-catalog/experimental/jbang-catalog.json`

== Local Alias Catalogs

JBang will also look in the current directory for a `jbang-catalog.json` file and if it exists it will look up any aliases
in there too. In fact it will look in several places in the following order:

 1. Current directory, `./jbang-catalog.json`
 2. In `./.jbang/jbang-catalog.json`
 3. In the parent directory, `../jbang-catalog.json`
 4. In the parent's `.jbang` directory, `../.jbang/jbang-catalog.json`
 5. And repeating steps 3 and 4 recursively upwards to the root of the file system
 6. As the last step it will look in `$HOME/.jbang/jbang-catalog.json`

JBang will use any aliases defined in those files, but on top of that it will also look at the aliases defined in any
catalogs mentioned in those files as well. Aliases defined in the file have preference over aliases found in any catalogs
defined in the same file.

When you create aliases using `jbang alias add`, or add catalogs using `jbang catalog add` the _same_ ordering will be used
to determine where to store the alias or catalog. Btw, this will only take into account _existing_ files!
So if no `jbang-catalog.json` file exists in the local directory it will _not_ be created for you, but JBang will keep
looking until it finds a file to use (as a last option it will always be written to `$HOME/.jbang/jbang-catalog.json`).

This means that if you want to write the alias to `jbang-catalog.json` in your local folder you will either have to create
the file first (eg by running `touch jbang-catalog.json`) or by explicitly specifying the file location:

  jbang alias add -f jbang-catalog.json hello https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-examples/blob/HEAD/examples/helloworld.java

Btw, the flag `--show-origin` is very useful when listing aliases to find out where exactly an alias is defined:

  jbang alias list --show-origin

== Catalogs

Catalogs are lists of Aliases as defined in the previous section, but while the `alias` command is used to manage aliases
within a catalog, the `catalog` command is for managing references to catalogs. This is mostly useful when dealing with
remote catalogs. You can for example add a catalog like this:

  jbang catalog add --name demo https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang-catalog/blob/HEAD/jbang-catalog.json

or simply by using the same "implicit" catalog system described in <<Implicit Alias Catalogs>>:

  jbang catalog add --name demo jbangdev

The aliases in that catalog are now available by adding `@demo` to their names. For example:

  $ jbang alias list demo
  env@demo = Dump table of Environment Variables
  gavsearch@demo = Search search.maven.org for maven artifacts.
  hello@demo = Script that says hello back for each argument
  properties@demo = Dump table of System properties
  $ jbang run hello@demo World!
  [jbang] Building jar...
  Hello World!

In fact, it's possible to run the alias just by using `jbang run hello`, the `@demo` part is only necessary when trying to
disambiguate between aliases with the same name from different catalogs.

You can list the available catalogs by running:

  jbang catalog list

NB: The output will not only show the catalogs you defined yourself but also the ones that get added implicitly when
running aliases as described in the section <<Implicit Alias Catalogs>>.
