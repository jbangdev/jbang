If you want the generated jar or native binary you can use `jbang export local <script>` to get it copied (exported)
for you to use directly.

Note, the local generated jar will have classpath references that are machine dependent. If you want a portable
jar use `jbang export portable <script>` and the dependent jars will be put in `lib` directory and
generated jar will have relative references to the jars in the `lib` folder.

== Exporting to Maven Repository

If your application or script need to be used from another java project it can be beneficial to publish your jar into a maven repository.
You can use `jbang export mavenrepo -Dgroup=dk.xam yourapp.java` to have it installed in your default maven repository, or use `-O target`
to get it exported to a directory named `target`.

You can control what maven coordinate will be used via properties named `group`, `artifact` and `version`.

=== Publish via jitpack

You can use `export mavenrepo` to publish any github hosted jbang app into a maven project by using a `jitpack.yml` as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
before_install:
  -  curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup
install:
  - ~/.jbang/bin/jbang export mavenrepo --force -O target -Dgroup=$GROUP -Dartifact=$ARTIFACT -Dversion=$VERSION hello.java
  - mkdir -p ~/.m2/repository
  - cp -rv target/* ~/.m2/repository/
----

You should only need to change `hello.java` to match your application/script.

You can read more about how jitpack handle builds at https://jitpack.io/docs/BUILDING/.
