If you want the generated jar or native binary you can use `jbang export local <script>` to get it copied (exported)
for you to use directly.

Note, the local generated jar will have classpath references that are machine dependent. If you want a portable
jar use `jbang export portable <script>` and the dependent jars will be put in `lib` directory and
generated jar will have relative references to the jars in the `lib` folder.

You can also use `jbang export gradle|maven <script>` to export the set of the script, its additional sources and resources, along with their dependencies, to a Gradle or Maven project, allowing you to proceed with full-scale development in your favorite IDE.

== Exporting to Maven Repository

If your application or script need to be used from another java project it can be beneficial to publish your jar into a maven repository.
You can use `jbang export mavenrepo -Dgroup=dk.xam yourapp.java` to have it installed in your default maven repository, or use `-O target`
to get it exported to a directory named `target`.

You can control what maven coordinate will be used via properties named `group`, `artifact` and `version`.

=== Publish via jitpack

You can use `export mavenrepo` to publish any github hosted jbang app into a maven project by using a `jitpack.yml` as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
before_install:
  -  curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup
install:
  - ~/.jbang/bin/jbang export mavenrepo --force -O target -Dgroup=$GROUP -Dartifact=$ARTIFACT -Dversion=$VERSION hello.java
  - mkdir -p ~/.m2/repository
  - cp -rv target/* ~/.m2/repository/
----

You should only need to change `hello.java` to match your application/script.

You can read more about how jitpack handle builds at https://jitpack.io/docs/BUILDING/.

== Exporting as a project

If you want to transition your developed script to a full-scale Java project, you can use `jbang export gradle|maven <script>` to export it as a Gradle or Maven project. If you have specified multiple sources or resources using `//SOURCES` or `//FILES` in the script, they will also be exported. Tags such as `//JAVA`, `//DEPS`, `//REPOS`, `//GAV`, and `//DESCRIPTION` will also be reflected in the exported `build.gradle` or `pom.xml`.

Unless explicitly specified via command options or tags, the GAV of the exported project defaults to `org.example:<script name>:999-SNAPSHOT`.

Let's say you want to export the following `hello.java` to a project:

[source,java]
----
///usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

//SOURCES model/Message.java
//FILES application.properties
//DEPS org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.17

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import model.Message;

public class hello {
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(hello.class);

    public static void main(String... args) {
        log.info("{}", new Message());
    }
}
----

=== To a Gradle project

You can export the script to a Gradle project with the GAV `org.acme:myapp:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` as follows:

[source,bash]
----
jbang export gradle --group org.acme --artifact myapp --version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT hello.java
----

The generated project would look like this:

[source]
----
hello
├── build.gradle
└── src
    └── main
        ├── java
        │   ├── model
        │   │   └── Message.java
        │   └── org
        │       └── acme
        │           └── myapp
        │               └── hello.java
        └── resources
            └── application.properties
----

The `build.gradle` file would include the following dependencies:

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:2.0.17'
}
----

=== To a Maven project

You can export the script to a Maven project with the GAV `org.acme:myapp:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` as follows:

[source,bash]
----
jbang export maven --group org.acme --artifact myapp --version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT hello.java
----

The generated project would look like this:

[source]
----
hello
├── pom.xml
└── src
    └── main
        ├── java
        │   ├── model
        │   │   └── Message.java
        │   └── org
        │       └── acme
        │           └── myapp
        │               └── hello.java
        └── resources
            └── application.properties
----

The `pom.xml` file would include the following dependencies:

[source,gradle]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>slf4j-simple</artifactId>
        <version>2.0.17</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
