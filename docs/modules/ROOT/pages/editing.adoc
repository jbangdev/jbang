You can edit your script in an IDE/editor by using `jbang edit helloworld.java`.

[source, bash]
----
jbang edit helloworld.java
----

or 

[source, bash]
----
jbang edit . helloworld.java
----

By default `jbang` will offer to install https://vscodium.com[VSCodium] (free/libre version of Visual Studio code) with default java extensions enabled in so called https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable["portable mode"]. Portable mode means all the installed binaries and configuration does not affect rest of your system; everything is stored in `~/.jbang/editor`.

This automatic install and setup of editor is fully optional and if you have another IDE or editor already installed use it using `jbang edit --open=<editor>` or set JBANG_EDITOR environment variable to have jbang use it by default.

[source, bash]
----
jbang edit --open=[editor] helloworld.java
----

If your IDE does not support JBang style project you can use "sandbox" (`-b`) mode where `jbang` will generate a project in a temporary location with symbolic links to your script and open a editor.

Finally you can also if you prefer to call the editor/IDE yourself in a shell that supports variable evaluation specify `--no-open` to tell JBang to not open an editor.

[source, bash]
----
code `jbang edit --no-open helloworld.java`
----

If you add further dependencies to your file just re-run the edit command and the relevant files will be regenerated with the updated dependencies.

NOTE: On Windows you might need elevated privileges to create symbolic links. If you don't have permissions then
the `edit` option will result in an error. To use it https://stackoverflow.com/a/24353758[enable symbolic links]
for your user or run your shell/terminal as administrator to have this feature working.

== Live Editing

You can also use `jbang edit --live` and `jbang` will launch your editor while watching
for file changes and regenerate the temporary project to pick up changes in dependencies.

== IDE Support

Some IDE's have dedicated JBang support and `jbang edit` assumes your IDE has this support installed.

If your IDE does not support JBang directly you can use "sandbox" mode a temporary project is created with
symoblic links and a project setup that works in most Java based IDE's. This is useful for single file scripts.
If you have multiple files we highly recommend to use a IDE that have JBang plugin.

The following IDE's have dedicated support (at time of writing):

== Sandbox edit support

The sandbox `edit -b` feature using temporary directory and symbolic links been tested with the following IDE's:

The `edit` feature works with various IDE's - it generates a `build.gradle` to use with IDE's that understands Gradle directly.
For speed and consistency `jbang` also generates IDE specific settings.

Currently launchers and project files are generated for Eclipse and vscode. Intellij just reads `build.gradle` for now thus
to run/debug you will need to manually set it up.

Some editors like Code or IDEA are not per default executable / startable from the command line. Here are some helpfull documentations for supporting command line usage of different editors:
