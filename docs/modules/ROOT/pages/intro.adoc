Want to learn, explore or use Java instantly without setup ?

Do you likeJava but use python, groovy, kotlin or similar languages for scripts, experimentation and exploration ?

Ever wanted to just be able to run java from anywhere without any or very minimal setup ?
Ever tried out Java 11+ support for running `.java` files directly in your shell but felt it was a bit too cumbersome ?

Then try `jbang` which lets you do this:

Instant app generated built using java and picocli as a dependency that was fetched as needed for the compilation and execution.

JBang goes beyond more than just easy scripting; you can use `jbang` to launch any kind of java application or library packaged as a jar available locally, via http/https download or in a Maven repository.

== Requirements

Tested and verified to use on OSX, Linux, AIX, Windows (incl. command.exe, cygwin and mingw shells).

[NOTE]

AIX requires the GNU `readlink` tool from the GNU coreutils to be available
in the PATH when running `jbang`.  This is not supplied by default with AIX.
Prebuilt versions can be obtained via the IBM AIX toolbox at 
https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/aix-toolbox-linux-applications-downloads-alpha
or elsewhere.
