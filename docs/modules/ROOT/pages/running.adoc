== Interactive REPL

`jbang --interactive` enables use of `jshell` to explore and use your script and any dependencies in a REPL editor.

When using `--interactive` for java/jar scripts/apps jbang sets up a jshell function named `userMain`. `userMain` delegates to
the main function that would have been called if not running in interactive. You can call it with arguments as follows `userMain(args)`.

NOTE: One caveat about jshell is that it cannot access classes in default package. Thus you will need to add a package statement
to your script/class to see it.

== Flight Recorder

Flight recorder is a feature of the Java VM that lets you gather diagnostic and profiling data about your script.

You can use `//RUNTIME_OPTIONS` to have full control over it; but for the easiest setup `jbang` lets you just run with `--jfr`, e.g.,

  jbang --jfr myapp.java

By default `--jfr` will start flight recorder and tell it to dump event recordings to `myapp.jfr` (i.e. using base name of the script as its filename).

Then you can use tools like `jvisualvm` or `jmc` to explore the data.

If you want to tweak the configuration you can pass flight recorder options, like `jbang --jfr=filename=\{basename}.jfr,maxage=24h` where `\{basename}` will be replaced
by the filename and then added `maxage=24h` to flight recording options.

If you want further control use `//COMPILE_OPTIONS -XX:StartFlightRecording=<your options>` instead.

== `java`, `javac` and `nativeimage` Options

You can pass options directly from JBang to the compiler and runtime tools that it uses to build and run your code.

The following source tags are available for setting JVM (`java`) options, compiler options (`javac`, `kotlinc`, etc) and native image builders (`nativeimage`) respectively: `//RUNTIME_OPTIONS`, `//COMPILE_OPTIONS` and `//NATIVE_OPTIONS`.

You can also set the same options from the command line using: `--runtime-option`, `--compile-option` and `--native-option`.

As an example, if you want to enable preview features you can set up the necessary options as in the following example that uses Java 14 experimental `record` feature:

[source, java]
----
///usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?
//COMPILE_OPTIONS --enable-preview -source 14
//RUNTIME_OPTIONS --enable-preview

import static java.lang.System.*;

public class records {

    record Point(int x, int y) {}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var p = new Point(2,4);
        out.println(p);
    }
}
----

Since Java 9 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/java.htm#GUID-3B1CE181-CD30-4178-9602-230B800D4FAE__USINGTHEJDK_JAVA_OPTIONSLAUNCHERENV-F3C0E3BA[JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS] and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/javac.htm#GUID-AEEC9F07-CB49-4E96-8BC7-BCC2C7F725C9\_\_USINGJDK_JAVAC_OPTIONSENVIRONMENTVA-F3C76845[JDK_JAVAC_OPTIONS] are also picked up by the Java runtime and compiler automatically.

For Java 8 and if you want to set explicitly only for `jbang` you can also add flags by setting `JBANG_JAVA_OPTIONS` and `JBANG_JAVAC_OPTIONS` respectively.


== Module support (EXPERIMENTAL)

You can mark code as being part of a module by adding the following line:

[source, java]
----
//MODULE <module-name>
----

This will make JBang treat the code a being a module with the given name, and it will compile it as such.
Any declared dependencies are automatically marked as being required.

You can also set this on the command line by using the `--module=<name>` option on the `jbang build` command.
The option also exists for `jbang run` where it will treat anything to be run as a module.

== Setting main class

Normally JBang will figure out by itself what your code's main class is, but in case you want to override
this behaviour in code, you can use the following line:

[source, java]
----
//MAIN <main-class-name>
----

The main class selected by the line is permanent and will be stored as the default main class in the
resulting JAR file.

One can also override the main class on the command line by using `--main <name>` or `-m <name>`
for `jbang build` or `jbang run`. Main classes set for `jbang build` are permanent, just like
using a `//MAIN` line in the code. But main classes set for `jbang run` are temporary and will
only be used for that execution run.

== Adding entries to `MANIFEST.MF`

If you want to set custom entries in the `MANIFEST.MF` file of the Jar file generated by JBang then you can
do so adding a `//MANIFEST` line to your source file. It takes a list of key=value items separated by spaces.
If an item has no equals sign and no value than the value is taken to be the string "true".

[source, java]
----
//MANIFEST Built-By=Shadowman Sealed
----


=== (Experimental) Application Class Data Sharing

If your scripts uses a lot of classes Class Data Sharing might help on your startup. The following requires Java 13+.

Using `--cds` jbang will build the jar with Application Class Data Sharing enabled and when run have it load shared class data.

You can put `//CDS` in the java file to enable it by default, or simply use `--cds` to force it or `--no-cds` to turn it off no matter what the jbang script file contains.

== Java Agents

You can activate a javaagent using `--javaagent=<agent>[=<options>]` where agent can be a already packaged agent jar from file, http url or Maven Coordinate.

It can also be a jbang script itself where you have put `//JAVAAGENT` to activate agent packaging.

You can create a basic agent using `jbang init -t agent myagent.java` to get started.

== Remote File Arguments

The `run` command has a special feature where any of the arguments for the code to be
executed can be a reference to a remote file by appending a `%` in front  of a URL.
Imagine for example a `wordcount.java` script that takes as its argument a path
to a file. Now with this feature we could write:

```
$ jbang run wordcount.java %https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/blob/main/README.md
```

JBang will download the given file to its local cache and then run the code with the path
to the file substituted for the URL. It will be as if the code has suddenly acquired the
feature to read and analyse remote files!

There is an alternative syntax in case the substitution needs to be part of an existing
text, for example when it has to be part of a flag passed to an application:

```
$ jbang run analyse.java --file=%{https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/blob/main/README.md}
```

In this case wrap the URL with braces to explicitly mark the beginning and end.

=== Remote-File for --javaagent

The remote-file syntax is also available for the `--javaagent` option for the `run`
command, for example:

```
$ jbang â€”javaagent=byteman@maxandersen=script:%{https://xam.dk/myscript.btm myapp.java}
```

As you can see it's necessary here to use the syntax with the braces because it's part
of larger string of text.

=== Escaping Remote-File Arguments

If, for some reason, you really need to be able to pass the text `%http://some.url` to
an application without JBang downloading the file and turning it into a file path for you,
then you simply add an extra `%` to the beginning. That will tell JBang to ignore what
follows and just treat it as an ordinary string of text. For example:

```
$ jbang run wordcount.java %%https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/blob/main/README.md
```

Would simply pass `%https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/blob/main/README.md` to the script.
