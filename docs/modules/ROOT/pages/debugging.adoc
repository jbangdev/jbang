When running `.java` scripts with `jbang` you can pass the `--debug`-flag and the script will enable debug,
suspend the execution and wait until you connect a debugger to port 4004.

[source, bash]
----
jbang --debug helloworld.java
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

You can change the debug port and host by passing in a interface pattern and number to the debug argument, e.g., `--debug=*:4321`.

This will make it use port 4321 and make it listen on all ('*') network interfaces.

NOTE: Be sure to put a breakpoint in your IDE/debugger before you connect to make the debugger actually stop when you need it.

== Debug info

JBang since version 0.100 compiles with debug info enabled by default. You can use `-C=-g` to tweak how much debug info is included: `jbang -C=-g=lines,vars,source` or to turn it off use `jbang -C=-g=none".

== Debug jbang itself

Java itself will add `JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS` which will apply to `jbang` too.

For finer and more explicit control the scripts, `jbang` will add `JBANG_JAVA_OPTIONS` to the call to `jbang` itself.
Thus if you want to enable debug or other details for `jbang` set that environment variable.
