To use `jbang` Java 8 is the minimum required version, however Java 17 or higher is recommended.
To use `jbang` Java 8 is the minimum required version, however Java 17 or higher is recommended.

Note: `jbang` will download and install `java` from Eclipse Temurin if no `java` is available.
Note: `jbang` will download and install `java` from Eclipse Temurin if no `java` is available.

There are multiple ways to install jbang. See below for all available options.

Once you have jbang installed, it is recommended you run `jbang app setup`. This script will make the following changes to your system:

1. Modify `PATH` environment variable to include jbang app scripts
2. For supported shells, add `j!` as an alias for `jbang`. Try running `j! version` to verify.

[NOTE]
====
By default `jbang` uses `~/.jbang` for configurations and build cache. This can be changed using the environment variable `JBANG_DIR`.

== Installation Methods

== Universal (All Platforms)

=== Using JBang (curl/bash)

Linux/OSX/Windows/AIX Bash:

[source, bash]
----
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup
----

Windows Powershell:

[source, powershell]
----
iex "& { $(iwr -useb https://ps.jbang.dev) } app setup"
----

=== Zero Install (curl/bash and Powershell)

Linux/OSX/Windows/AIX Bash:

[source, bash]
----
curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - <arguments>
----

For example `curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - properties@jbangdev`

Windows Powershell:

[source, powershell]
----
iex "& { $(iwr -useb https://ps.jbang.dev) } <arguments>"
----

For example `iex "& { $(iwr -useb https://ps.jbang.dev) } properties@jbangdev"`

=== Manual install

Unzip the https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/releases/latest[latest binary release], add the `jbang-<version>/bin` folder to your `$PATH` and you are set.

=== Wrapper install

If you would like to have `jbang` available in a local directory and committed into a source code repository (akin to Maven and Gradle wrappers) you can use the `jbang wrapper` command.

If you have `jbang` already installed you call `jbang wrapper install` in a folder to install a local `jbang`
that will run out of that directory using `./jbang`.

The `./.jbang` directory which `jbang wrapper install` creates is just a cache which you typically would not commit to a source code repository, so you can e.g. `echo .jbang/ >>.gitignore`.

== Linux & macOS

=== SDKMan

Although if you want to have easy updates or install multiple JBang versions we recommend
https://sdkman.io[sdkman] to install both java and `jbang` on Linux and OSX.

[source, bash]
----
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash # <.>
source ~/.bash_profile # <.>

sdk install java # <.>
----

Once Java is installed and ready, you install `jbang` with

[source, bash]
----
sdk install jbang
----

To test your installation run:

[source, bash]
----
jbang --help
----

This should print out usage information.

To update run:

[source]
----
sdk upgrade jbang
----

You can install JBang using the asdf version manager:

[source,bash]
----
asdf plugin-add jbang
asdf install jbang latest

[source, bash]
----
brew install temurin@17 --cask
----

Once Java is installed you can use brew with https://github.com/jbangdev/homebrew-tap/[jbangdev/tap] to get `jbang`:
