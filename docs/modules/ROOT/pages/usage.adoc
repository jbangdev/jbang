A minimal script is a single `.java` file with a typical `static void main` method or a `.jsh` file which will be passed to `jshell`.

Below is an (almost) minimal example you can save in `helloworld.java` or simply run `jbang init helloworld.java`:

[source,java]
----
///usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $? # <.>

class helloworld { // <.>

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if(args.length==0) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]);
        }
    }
}
----
<.> By using this `//` style instead of shebang `#!` you trick `bash`, `zsh` etc. to run this as a script while still being valid java code.
<.> A classname, can be anything when using `jbang` but to be valid java for most IDEs you'll want to name it the same as the source file.

Now to run this you can call it via `jbang`:

[source]
----
jbang helloworld.java
----

or if on Linux/OSX/AIX run it directly. If you created it manually you need to mark it as executable before running it.

[source]
----
chmod +x helloworld.java
./helloworld.java jbang!
----

[WARNING]
====
When no <<java-version,JDK version>> is available in the PATH, JDK 11 will be downloaded by default to bootstrap jbang.
If your script requires a higher version and you don' want to download two JDK's, you can define an alternative default with `JBANG_DEFAULT_JAVA_VERSION` env variable.

 $ JBANG_DEFAULT_JAVA_VERSION=14 jbang my-script.java

Note that if JDK is found in the PATH, `JBANG_DEFAULT_JAVA_VERSION` will be ignored.
====

== Default application

If you pass a directory or a url ending in `/` jbang will look for `main.java` to run as default application for that directory / location.

== URLs from Trusted Sources

You can use `http(s):/` and `file:/` url's for input:.

[source]
----
jbang https://gist.github.com/maxandersen/f43b4c52dfcfc42dcd59a04e49acf6ec
----

For safety reasons jbang will not run arbitrary urls before you indicated you trust their source.
Thus when running the above for the first time you will see the following warning about the url not being a trusted source:

[source,bash]
----
jbang https://gist.github.com/maxandersen/f43b4c52dfcfc42dcd59a04e49acf6ec
[jbang] https://gist.github.com/maxandersen/f43b4c52dfcfc42dcd59a04e49acf6ec is not from a trusted source thus not running it automatically.

If you trust the url to be safe to run you can do one of the following:
0) Trust once: Add no trust, just run this time
1) Trust this url in future:
    jbang trust add https://gist.github.com/maxandersen/


Any other response will result in exit.

[jbang] Type in your choice (0 or 1) and hit enter. Times out after 10 seconds.
----

You can then choose 0 to run once or 1 to trust the suggested url. If you don't answer within 10 seconds jbang will exit.

To enable running it without such question you need to mark that url or a sub part of it as a trusted source.
i.e. `jbang trust add https://github.com/maxandersen/` will tell `jbang` to trust anything with that base url.

You can see more in the comments of the `~/.jbang/trusted-sources.json`.

[TIP]
====
Sites such as GitHub, gitlab, bitbucket, gist, carbon.now.sh jbang will try and extract the proper source rather than the raw html.
i.e. doing `jbang https://carbon.now.sh/ae51bf967c98f31a13cba976903030d5 carbon!` is possible.
====

[TIP]
====
URL's will follow redirects. In case you need to use it with sites with self-signed/non-trusted certificates you can
if you trust the site use `--insecure`.
====

== Build and run native image (Experimental)

There is support for using `native-image` from GraalVM project to produce a binary executable.

Since not all java libraries can automatically be built with `native-image` - especially if using reflection feature are considered highly experimental.

Just run `jbang --native helloworld.java` and `jbang` will use `native-image` from either `$JAVA_HOME/bin` or `$GRAALVM_HOME/bin` or `$PATH` to
produce a native image binary.

You can install the `native-image` utility binary e.g. by installing GraalVM from https://www.graalvm.org/downloads, and then once running `gu install native-image` as per https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image.


[TIP]
====
If you use `--native` with picocli remember to add `info.picocli:picocli-codegen` as that will ensure it will actually work with `native-image`.
====


== Using `.jsh` for `jshell`

There is support to run `.jsh` via `jshell`. The advantage of `jshell` is that you do not need to have a class or static main method.

Classic `jshell` does not support passing in arguments nor system properties, `jbang` does.

In the case of `.jsh` files `jbang` injects a startup script that declares a `String[] args` which will contain any passed in arguments,
and it sets any properties passed in as `-Dkey=value` as parameters to `jbang`.

That means you can run a script as `jbang -Dkey=value helloworld.jsh World` and retrieve arguments and properties as:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println("Hello " + (args.length>0?args[0]:"World")); // <.>
System.out.println(System.getProperty("key")); // <.>
----
<.> Line where `args` are accessible without previous declaration.
<.> System properties set when passed as `-D` arguments to `jbang`

The script will have the output:

 Hello World
 value

Please note that `.jsh` files are source only, they are not compiled thus they are https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/issues/506[not cached] nor can they be https://github.com/jbangdev/jbang/issues/510[built as native images].

[TIP]
====
If you use `-Dkey` where no value is specified `jbang` will interpret this as `-Dkey=true` allowing you to easily have
flags passed into, i.e. `jbang -DskipTests mytestrunner.java`. Now within your script `Boolean.getBoolean('skipTests') will return true.
====

== Running Kotlin (.kt) (EXPERIMENTAL)

As an experiment since 0.71.0 JBang supports building Kotlin files using `kotlinc`.

[source,bash]
----
jbang init -t hello.kt hello.kt
./hello.kt
[jbang] Downloading Kotlin 1.5.0. Be patient, this can take several minutes...
[jbang] Installing Kotlin 1.5.0...
[jbang] Building jar...
Hello World
----

== Running script from standard input

jbang can run scripts directly from standard input using `-` or `/dev/stdin` as input.

i.e.

`echo 'System.out.println("Hello World!");' | jbang -`

[TIP]
====
If you use `--interactive` `jbang` will let `jshell` enter into interactive/REPL mode. You can write `/exit` to leave this mode.
====

[TIP]
====
If your own code needs to handle chained pipes well it is recommended to add the following code:

[source,java]
----
import sun.misc.Signal;

if (!"Windows".equals(System.getProperty("os.name"))) {
    Signal.handle(new Signal("PIPE"), (final Signal sig) -> System.exit(1));
}
----

It will give a compiler warning as it is internal API; but for now it works.
====

== Running ``.jar``'s

`jbang` will also run `.jar` files directly.

i.e. `jbang helloworld.jar` will run `helloworld.jar` if found on your local file system.

The `.jar` can be a local file or a http/https url.

You can also run a `.jar` file referenced by a Maven coordinate, i.e.:

  jbang info.picocli:picocli-codegen:4.5.0

This will fetch the dependency stated and put the transitive dependencies on the class-path.

If you need to specify a main class you can do so by using `--main` i.e.

  jbang --main picocli.codegen.aot.graalvm.ReflectionConfigGenerator info.picocli:picocli-codegen:4.5.0

[TIP]
====
A side effect of running GAV as a jar, the GAV could also be a `.java` or `.jsh` file and it would be launched as a script instead of a jar.
No one would want to do that (right?) but now you know.
====

== Usage on Windows

Some JBang commands need to create symbolic links when running on Windows.
For example, this is required for Managing JDKs or editing the files with the `edit` command.
To resolve the issue, on Windows 10 you will need to enable symbolic linking for your user account.

* Review security considerations and best practices https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/create-symbolic-links[here].
* Enable the `Create symbolic links` group policy setting for your user/group
  by following the guidelines on the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-rights-assignment[User Rights Assignment] page.

You might also need elevated privileges to create symbolic links
If the JBang process has no full administrative rights, the execution may result in an error like:

```
java.nio.file.FileSystemException: <CURRENT_JDK>: A required privilege is not held by the client.
```

To resolve this issue, see the options in https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance-winpc/how-to-fix-problem-a-required-privilege-is-not/d206b4b3-b6c2-4b0b-8629-5d4dfcb8f8d0[this answers.microsoft.com article].
There are multiple possible resolutions,
choose one meeting your needs.

For older Windows versions, see this https://stackoverflow.com/a/24353758[StackOverflow issue].
