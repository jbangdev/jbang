To get started you can run `jbang init helloworld.java` and a simple java class with a static main is generated.

Using `jbang init --template=cli helloworld.java` you get a more complete Hello World CLI using https://picocli.info/[picocli] as dependency.

Run `jbang template list` to see the full list of templates that are available.

It's also possible to create your own templates using the `jbang template add` command. For example, running:

[source,bash]
----
$ jbang template add --name logo showlogo.java img.jpg some.properties
----

Would add a template named "logo" with 3 files which could then be instantiated running `jbang init -t=logo mylogo`.

When instantiating a template the paths of the source files are ignored. So the following template:

[source,bash]
----
$ jbang template add --name logo src/showlogo.java images/img.jpg resources/some.properties
----

Has the exact same result as the previous example.

It's also possible to give the instantiated files (the targets) different names or different paths than their originals
(the sources), like this:

[source,bash]
----
$ jbang template add --name logo \
    src/showlogo.java=showlogo.java \
    img/img.jpg=img.jpg \
    resources/logo.properties=some.properties
----

Btw, if you'd try to run the last command (and assuming the source files would exist) you'd get an error saying:

[source,bash]
----
$ jbang template add --name logo ...
[jbang] [ERROR] A target pattern is required. Prefix at least one of the files with '\\{filename}=' or '\\{basename}.ext='
----

This is because at least one of the files needs a target (the part before the `=` sign) that contains a "pattern".
That pattern is the part of the name that will be replaced with the name that you pass to `jbang init`
(if you type `jbang init helloworld.java` any occurrence of `\{filename}` would be replaced with `helloworld.java`,
while any occurrence of `\{basename}` would be replaced with `helloworld`).

If you don't specify a "target patterns" for any of the file JBang will try to pick one for you.
Basically if the first file you specify doesn't have a target it will use that and add a pattern.
You will see something like this if it was successful:

[source,bash]
----
$ jbang template add showlogo.java img.jpg some.properties
[jbang] No explicit target pattern was set, using first file: \{basename}.java=showlogo.java
[jbang] Template 'showlogo' added to '.../jbang-catalog.json'
----

== Properties

Templates can refer to properties passed in using `-Dkey=value` on the `jbang init` command.

Any key specified via `-Dkey=value` becomes available as `{key}` inside the templates.

It is recommended you write templates where there is some kind of valid default or fallback on behavior as users might not be aware there is need for a key.
