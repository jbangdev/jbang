= JBang Examples

This folder contains example programs that are included in the JBang documentation. Keeping the examples as runnable source files outside of the Asciidoc documentation files ensures that the programs can be tested and updated without having to update any documentation files.

== Formatting

In order to make best use of the limited space available to present source code examples, we use the Google Java Formatting style which indents the code by two spaces.

The Google Java Formatting style do not support JBang comments such as `//DEPS` and will format it as `// DEPS`. After formatting a program file, fix the spacing in the file with `FixCommentSpacing.java`.
