== How to run integration tests

In addition to the unit tests driven by gradle this directory
contains tests using https://github.com/andamira/aserta[aserta].

A bash driven testing suite runner which allows to do easy testing
running in a shell.

To run the tests first make sure you've built jbang first, added `jbang` to the path, cd to this directory and run the link:test_suite.sh[test_suite.sh].

[source, bash]
----
./gradlew build installDist
export PATH=`pwd`/build/install/jbang/bin:$PATH
cd itests
./test_suite.sh
----

== Integration tests

Historically the integration tests were done using Karate .feature files.
Today that is all ported to using junit ITests using Allure for capturing the results.

To run the tests just do a `./gradlew integrationTest` or `just itest` from the root.

To open the test report do a `just openitest` from the root.
