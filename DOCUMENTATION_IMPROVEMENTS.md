# JBang Documentation Reorganization

## Overview

This PR represents a comprehensive restructuring of the JBang documentation to address organic growth issues and significantly improve user experience. The documentation has been reorganized from a flat structure into a logical, hierarchical system with focused, digestible content.

## Major Structural Changes

### 1. Complete File Restructuring

**Before**: 17+ scattered files with significant overlap and a massive 375-line `usage.adoc`

**After**: Organized, focused files with clear purposes:

#### New Files Created:
- `quickstart.adoc` - Comprehensive quick start guide
- `first-script.adoc` - Your first script (extracted from usage.adoc)
- `multiple-languages.adoc` - JShell, Kotlin, Groovy, Markdown support
- `execution-options.adoc` - JVM options, debugging, profiling
- `native-images.adoc` - Comprehensive native image guide
- `remote-execution.adoc` - URLs, trusted sources, JAR execution
- `app-installation.adoc` - Installing scripts as system commands
- `troubleshooting.adoc` - Combined troubleshooting + FAQ content

#### Files Replaced/Reorganized:
- ‚ùå `usage.adoc` (375 lines) ‚Üí ‚úÖ 5 focused files
- üîÑ `install.adoc` ‚Üí `app-installation.adoc` (clearer naming)
- üîÑ Content from `running.adoc` ‚Üí `execution-options.adoc`
