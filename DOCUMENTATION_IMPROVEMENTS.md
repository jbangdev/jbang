  - Clear installation options
  - Better community and documentation links

### 5. Better Cross-References
- Added extensive cross-references between related topics
- Clear navigation paths for different user types
- Consistent linking structure throughout documentation

## Features Coverage Analysis

All existing features are still documented and no content was removed. The improvements focus on:

### ‚úÖ Fully Covered Features
- Installation (multiple methods)
- Basic usage and scripting
- Dependency management (//DEPS, repositories, BOM POMs)
- Multiple file types (.java, .jsh, .kt, .groovy, .md)
- IDE integration and editing
- Templates and initialization
- Aliases and catalogs
- Exporting projects
- Native image generation
- Configuration and caching
- CLI reference (complete command documentation)
- FAQ and troubleshooting

### ‚úÖ Enhanced Coverage
- **Quick Start**: New dedicated guide for new users
- **Navigation**: Clear learning progression
- **Examples**: More practical, real-world examples
- **Cross-references**: Better linking between related topics

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas for Future Enhancement
While all features are covered, these areas could benefit from additional examples:
- **Advanced JavaFX usage**: Currently covered but could use more examples
- **Integration patterns**: Maven/Gradle plugin usage examples
- **Advanced templating**: Custom template creation workflows
- **Performance tuning**: Cache optimization strategies

## User Experience Improvements

## Future Recommendations

1. **Add more visual elements**: Screenshots of IDE integration, command outputs
2. **Create tutorial series**: Step-by-step guides for common patterns
3. **Add troubleshooting section**: Common issues and solutions
4. **Performance guide**: Tips for optimizing JBang scripts
5. **Best practices**: Coding conventions and project organization

## Conclusion

This reorganization makes JBang documentation more approachable for new users while maintaining comprehensive coverage for experienced users. The clear navigation structure and Quick Start Guide should significantly improve the new user experience while the organized reference material serves power users effectively.

The documentation now provides a clear learning path from "What is JBang?" to advanced features, making it easier for users to find what they need and discover new capabilities.
