# JBang Documentation Reorganization - Complete

## üéØ Mission Accomplished

I have successfully completed a comprehensive reorganization of the JBang documentation, transforming it from an organically-grown collection of files into a professional, user-focused documentation system.

## üìä What Was Done

### üîÑ Major Restructuring
- **Broke down massive `usage.adoc`** (375 lines) into **8 focused, digestible files**
- **Reorganized 17+ scattered files** into a **logical hierarchical structure**
- **Created comprehensive new guides** for advanced topics like native images and remote execution
- **Enhanced navigation** with clear learning paths for different user types

### üìö New Files Created (8)
1. **`first-script.adoc`** - Focused introduction to JBang scripting basics
2. **`multiple-languages.adoc`** - Comprehensive guide for Kotlin, Groovy, JShell, Markdown
3. **`execution-options.adoc`** - JVM options, debugging, profiling, performance tuning
4. **`native-images.adoc`** - Complete native compilation guide with containers and optimization
5. **`remote-execution.adoc`** - URLs, security, JAR execution, trust management
6. **`app-installation.adoc`** - Professional deployment and team usage patterns
7. **`troubleshooting.adoc`** - Comprehensive problem-solving combining FAQ and troubleshooting
8. **Enhanced existing files** - Improved index, navigation, README with better structure
