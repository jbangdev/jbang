== Intro

Want to learn or explore Java instantly without setup ?

Do you like Java but uses python, groovy, kotlin or similar languages for your scripts ?

Ever tried out Java 10+ support for running `.java` files directly in your shell but felt it was a bit too cumbersome ?

Then try `jbang` which lets you do this:

== Requirements

Minimum Java 8, Recommended: Java 11+

Tested and verified to use on OSX, Linux and Windows.

== Installation

To use `jbang` you as a minimum need to have Java 8 available, we though recommend Java 11 or higher.

=== SDKMan icon:linux[] / icon:apple[]

To install both java and `jbang` we recommend https://sdkman.io[sdkman] on Linux and OSX.

[source, bash]
----
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash # <.>
source ~/.bash_profile # <.>

sdk install java # <.>
----

Once Java is installed and ready, you install `jbang` with

[source, bash]
----
sdk install jbang
----

To test your installation run:

[source, bash]
----
jbang --help
----

This should print out usage information.

To update run:

[source]
----
sdk update jbang
----

=== Chocolatey icon:windows[]
[[chocolatey, Chocolatey]]

On Windows you can install both `java` and jbang` with https://chocolatey.org[Chocolatey].

From a command prompt with enough rights to install with choco:

`choco install jdk11`

Once Java in installed run:

`choco install jbang`

To upgrade to latest version:

`choco upgrade jbang`

The latest package will be published to https://chocolatey.org/packages/jbang[jbang choco package page],
it might be a bit delayed as the review is still manual. In case the default version is not
the latest you can see the https://chocolatey.org/packages/jbang/#versionhistory[version list] and install specific version using:

`choco install jbang --version=<version number>`

=== Scoop icon:windows[]

On Windows you can also install jbang` with https://scoop.sh[Scoop].

[source, bash]
----
scoop bucket add maxandersen https://github.com/maxandersen/scoop-bucket
scoop install jbang
----

To upgrade to latest version:

`scoop update jbang`

=== Homebrew icon:apple[]

On OSX you can install 'java' and `jbang` with https://brew.sh[Homebrew] using custom taps.

To install Java 11:

[source, bash]
----
brew tap AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk
brew cask install adoptopenjdk11
----

Once Java is installed you can use brew with https://github.com/maxandersen/homebrew-tap/[maxandersen/tap] to get `jbang`:

  brew install maxandersen/tap/jbang

To upgrade to latest version:

  brew upgrade maxandersen/tap/jbang

==== Installing older versions via Homebrew

If you encounter an issue in `jbang` that is not present in an older version,
you can revert back to that older version following these steps:

. Find the commit id for the version to revert to (e.g. `0.8.1`).
+
```
$ cd "$(brew --repo maxandersen/tap)"
$ git log master -- Formula/jbang.rb
...
commit fd70f1bc0a7f69d81cfb5b08a0d2bb698fbd01b2

```
+
. Verify the version.
+
```bash
$ jbang --version
0.8.1
```

=== Docker / GitHub Action icon:docker[]

You can run `jbang` via Docker:

[source, bash]
----
docker run -v `pwd`:/ws --workdir=/ws maxandersen/jbang-action helloworld.java
----

or if you prefer usign Quay.io:

[source, bash]
----
docker run -v `pwd`:/ws --workdir=/ws quay.io/maxandersen/jbang-action helloworld.java
----

The same container images can be used with GitHub Actions, see https://github.com/maxandersen/jbang-action[jbang-action] for details.

=== Manual install

Unzip the https://github.com/maxandersen/jbang/releases/latest[latest binary release], put the `jbang-<version>/bin` folder in to your `$PATH` and you are set.

== Usage

A script is just a single `.java` file with a classic static main method or a `.jsh` file which will be passed to `jshell`.

Below is an (almost) minimal example you can save in `helloworld.java` or simply run `jbang --init hellworld.java`:

[source, java]
```
//usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $? // <.>

class helloworld { // <.>

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        if(args.length==0) {
            System.out.println("Hello World!");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Hello " + args[0]);
        }
    }
}
```
<.> By using this `//` style instead of shebang `#!` you trick `bash`, `zsh` etc. to run this as a script while still being valid java code.
<.> A classname, can be anything when using `jbang` but to be valid java for most IDE's you'll want to name it the same as the source file.

Now to run this you can call it via `jbang`:

[source]
----
jbang helloworld.java
----

or if on Linux/OSX run it directly. If you created it manually you need to mark it as executable before running it.
[source]
----
chmod +x helloworld.java
./helloworld jbang!
----

You can use `http(s):/` and `file:/` url's for input too:

[source]
----
jbang https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxandersen/jbang/master/examples/helloworld.java
----

=== Using `.jsh` for `jshell`

There are support to run `.jsh` via `jshell`. The advantage of `jshell` is that you do not need to have a class or static main method.

Classic `jshell` does not support passing in arguments, `jbang` does.

In the case of `.jsh` files `jbang` injects a startup script that declares a `String[] args` which will contain any passed in arguments.

Example:

[source, java]
----
System.out.println("Hello " + (args.length>0?args[0]:"World")); // <.>
/exit // <.>
----
<1> Line where `args` are accessible without previous declaration.
<2> `/exit` is so the jshell app will exit. If you remove it `jbang` will launch into inter-active mode.

== Init templates

To get started you can run `jbang --init helloworld.java` and a simple java class with a static main is generated.

Using `jbang --init=cli helloworld.java` you get a more complete Hello World CLI using picocli as dependencies.

== Declare dependencies

If you want to write real scripts you will want to use some java libraries.
To specify dependencies you use gradle-style locators. Below are examples for `log4j`.

=== Using `//DEPS`

[source, java]
```
//usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

//DEPS log4j:log4j:1.2.17 <.>

import static java.lang.System.out;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator;

import java.util.Arrays;

class classpath_example {

	static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(classpath_example.class);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BasicConfigurator.configure(); // <.>
		logger.info("Welcome to jbang");

		Arrays.asList(args).forEach(arg -> logger.warn("arg: " + arg));
		logger.info("Hello from Java!");
	}
}
```
<.> //DEPS has to be start of line and can be one or more space separated dependencies.
<.> Minimal logging setup - required by log4j.

Now when you run this the first time with no existing dependencies installed you should get an output like this:

[source]
----
$ ./classpath_example.java
[jbang] Resolving dependencies...
[jbang]     Resolving log4j:log4j:1.2.17...Done
[jbang] Dependencies resolved
0 [main] INFO classpath_example  - Welcome to jbang
1 [main] INFO classpath_example  - Hello from Java!
----

=== Using `@Grab`

There is also support for using Groovy lang style `@Grab` syntax.

[source, java]
----
//usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?

import static java.lang.System.out;

import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
import org.apache.log4j.BasicConfigurator;

import java.util.Arrays;

import groovy.lang.Grab; // <.>
import groovy.lang.Grapes;

@Grapes({ // <.>
		@Grab(group="org.codehaus.groovy", module="groovy", version="2.5.8"), // <.>
		@Grab(module = "log4j", group = "log4j", version = "1.2.17")
})
class classpath_example {

	static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(classpath_example.class);

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		BasicConfigurator.configure();
		Arrays.asList(args).forEach(arg -> out.println(arg));
	}
}
----
<.> Import needed to make the compiler be okey with `@Grab` annotation.
<.> In Groovy you normally put `@Grab` on import statements. That is not allowed in Java thus when having multiple imports you need to put them in a `@Grapes` annotation first.
<.> `jbang` will grab any `@Grab` annotation and assume it is declaring dependencies.

== Editing

You can edit your script in your IDE by using `jbang --edit helloworld.java`. This will generate a project in a temporary location with symbolic links to your script
and output the generated folder name. The easiest way to use that is to use it in a call to your IDE:

[source, bash]
----
code `jbang --edit helloworld.java`
----

If you add additional dependencies to your file just re-run the edit command and the relevant files will be regenerated with the updated dependencies.

NOTE: On Windows you might need elevated priviliges to create symbolic links. If you don't have permissions then
the `--edit` option will result in an error. To use it enable symbolic links for your user or run your shell/terminal as administrator
to have this feature working.

=== IDE and Editor support

The `--edit` feature been tested with the following IDE's:

|image:{sicons}/gnuemacs.svg[50,50] https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/[Emacs] w/ https://www.spacemacs.org[Spacemacs Java]
|===

The `--edit` feature works with various IDE's - it generates a `build.gradle` to use with IDE's that understands Gradle directly.
For speed and consistency `jbang` also generates IDE specific settings.

Currently launchers and project files are generated for Eclipse and vscode. Intellij just reads `build.gradle` for now thus
to run/debug you will need to manually set it up.

== Debugging

When running `.java` scripts with `jbang` you can pass the `--debug`-flag and the script will enable debug,
suspend the execution and wait until you connect a debugger to port 4004.

[source, bash]
----
jbang --debug helloworld.java
Listening for transport dt_socket at address: 4004
----

You can change the debug port by passing in a number to the debug argument, i.e. `--debug=4321`.

NOTE: Be sure to put a breakpoint in your IDE/debugger before you connect to make the debugger actually stop when you need it.

== `java` and `javac` Options

If you want to tweak memory settings or enable preview features you can setup the necessary options using
`//JAVA_OPTS` and `//COMPILER_OPTS` as in the following example using Java 14 experimental `record` feature:

[source, java]
----
//usr/bin/env jbang "$0" "$@" ; exit $?
//JAVAC_OPTIONS --enable-preview -source 14 <.>
//JAVA_OPTIONS --enable-preview // <.>

import static java.lang.System.*;

public class records {

    record Point(int x, int y) {}

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var p = new Point(2,4);
        out.println(p);
    }
}
----

Since Java 9 https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/java.htm#GUID-3B1CE181-CD30-4178-9602-230B800D4FAE__USINGTHEJDK_JAVA_OPTIONSLAUNCHERENV-F3C0E3BA[JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS] and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/tools/javac.htm#GUID-AEEC9F07-CB49-4E96-8BC7-BCC2C7F725C9\_\_USINGJDK_JAVAC_OPTIONSENVIRONMENTVA-F3C76845[JDK_JAVAC_OPTIONS] are also picked up by the Java runtime and compiler automatically.

For Java 8 and if you want to set explicilty only for `jbang` you can also add flags by setting `JBANG_JAVA_OPTIONS` and `JBANG_JAVAC_OPTIONS` respectively.

=== `JAVA_HOME` vs `PATH`

If `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set that will be used over what is in the path.

Allows you to expliclity control what JDK you are using for `jbang`, i.e.

`JAVA_HOME=~/sdkman/candidates/java/14.ea.302-open/bin/java jbang examples/records.java`

This will use Java 14 from sdkman no matter what your `PATH` or `JAVA_HOME` contains in the shell environment.

== Bash/Zsh auto-completion

If you are using bash or zsh in your terminal you can get auto-completion by running the following:

[source, bash]
----
source <(jbang --completion)
----

== Caching

In previous versions of `jbang` Java 10+ direct launch of `.java` was used, but since v0.6 `jbang` works with Java 8 and thus it
needs to do a separate compile step. Besides now working with Java 8 it also allow us to cache the compile step and thus
launch faster on consecutive runs.

The caching goes to `~/.jbang` by default, you can run `jbang --clear-cache` to remove all cache data from this folder.

== FAQ

[qanda]
Why the name j'bang?::
  I was reading up on how to use the new shebang (#!) feature support in Java 10 and came up with the idea of port `kscript` to Java and needed a name.
From there came j'bang which is a "bad" spelling of how shebang is pronounced in french.

Why use of gradle resource locators rather than ?::
  kscript used it and its nice as it is a one-liner and easily parsable.

Why would I use Java to write scripts ? Java sucks for that... Use gradle, kotlin, scala, etc. instead!::
  Well, does it really suck ? With Java 8 streams, static imports and greatly improved standard java libraries it is very close to how kscript and grape looks like.
With the following advantages:
+
* works with plain Java without installing additional compiler/build tools
* all IDE's support editing .java files very well, content assist etc.
* great debugging
+
And to be honest I built `jbang` just to see if I could and get my Java skills refreshed for the newer features in the language.
Use it at your own risk :)

Why not use normal shebang(`#!`) in the header ?::
  You can use normal shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env jbang`) and Java 10+ will actually work with it from the command line. Not recommended though as
many tools and especially IDE's will start complaining about syntax errors as they don't ignore the first line in this case.
+
By using the `//` form it is treated as both a bash/shell file AND a valid java file and thus works everywhere a java file will work.
+
Its worth noting that Go https://golangcookbook.com/chapters/running/shebang/[uses a similar approach] which is also where I learned it from.

== Thanks

`jbang` was heavily inspired by how `https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript[kscript]` by Holger Brand works.
