Want to learn, explore or use Java instantly without setup ?

Do you like Java but use python, groovy, kotlin or similar languages for scripts, experimentation and exploration ?

Ever wanted to just be able to run java from anywhere without any or very minimal setup ?
Ever tried out Java 11+ support for running `.java` files directly in your shell but felt it was a bit too cumbersome ?

Then try `jbang` which lets you do this:

== AppStore

JBang goes beyond more than just easy scripting; you can use `jbang` to launch any kind of java application or library packaged as a jar available locally, via http/https download or in a Maven repository. You can even setup catalogs of scripts and publish them to github, gitlab or bitbucket - see https://jbang.dev/appstore[AppStore] for examples.

== Documentation

Full documentation at https://jbang.dev/documentation. For a project architecture overview refer to https://sourcespy.com/github/jbangdevjbang/[build, module, dependency and other diagrams].

== Thanks

`jbang` was heavily inspired by how `https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript[kscript]` by Holger Brand works.
